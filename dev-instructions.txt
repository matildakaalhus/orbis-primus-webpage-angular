If you want to preview the webpage on another device:
- Turn on mobile tethering on that device
- Connect your computer to that network
- Check the IP address of your computer by entering the following in the terminal:
$ ifconfig
(The IP address is probably something like 192.168.XX.XXX)
- Enter that IP and port 4200 into the browser on the device (192.168.XX.XXX:4200)

Alternatively, most browsers have the option of viewing in different resolutions. 
F12 in Chrome opens 'Developer mode' and the top left corner has a 'Toggle device 
toolbar' to view in common non-desktop resolutions.

To build the project:
- Enter the following into the terminal:
$ ng build --prod
- Navigate to www.one.com, log in to the web page handler. Go to the control panel from the drop down menu.
- Go to the file handler (Filer och sakerhet). Empty the folder called 'old' and move the current files into it. 
Move the newly generated files from dist/orbis-primus-webpage into the root map. Check if the .php files are included 
in the root, otherwise they have to be copied from the 'old' map and moved into root so the emailing etc. works. Check 
the webpage at orbisprimus.se, test the booking handler by sending a junk booking.
